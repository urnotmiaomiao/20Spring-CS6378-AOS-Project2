Here is some time slot for my demo video. Hope this could be helpful :)

0:00:00 downloaded project, uploaded jar files to servers, created s0-s6 folders
0:03:50 run project - network, TCP connection
0:04:54 test 1st case - created object1, updated object1, checked object1's content
0:10:28 test 2nd case - disabled connection
0:17:16 test 2nd case - clients in 2 different partitions tried to update object1, and their results


Below are commands and network partition I used in the demo.

cd Client
java -jar AClient.jar

cd Server
java -jar AServer.jar

mkdir s0
mkdir s1
mkdir s2
mkdir s3
mkdir s4
mkdir s5
mkdir s6

1: s0 s1 s5 s6  c0 c1 c2

2: s2 s3 s4  c3 c4

object1 s4-6
